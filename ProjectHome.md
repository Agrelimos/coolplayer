CoolPlayer - Blazing fast audio player.


### Features: ###
Skins, Simple user interface, Playlist editor, Internet streaming, File Renamer, Fast mp3->wav converter, Smallest executable, Continuous play (no pause between tracks), programmed in C.


### Notes: ###
This is not the official page. I only created this fork to update the 3rd party libraries and make a few minor changes. Most important is that CoolPlayer can be built with WDK which produces smaller binaries with a smaller memory footprint than MSVC. Also an x64 build is available.

Known issue: OGG playback is broken.


### Supported Operating Systems: ###
Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7 both 32-bit and 64-bit


(if you build CoolPlayer with MSVC2010 then Windows 2000 is not supported)
